## **Project Overview**

Uber is one of the largest ride-hailing companies globally, serving millions of customers daily. Accurate fare estimation is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and improving customer satisfaction. This project leverages machine learning to analyze past trip data and build a predictive model for estimating fares for future rides.

## **Problem Statement**

With thousands of daily transactions, Uber handles an immense amount of data. Accurate fare predictions are crucial for:
- Enhancing customer experience.
- Supporting business decisions.
- Managing operational costs efficiently.

This project focuses on forecasting ride fares based on historical data and key factors like trip distance, time, and location.
